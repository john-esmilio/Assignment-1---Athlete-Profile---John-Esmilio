        <h2>The Debut</h2>
        <p>Born in 1978, Wurzburg, Germany, Dirk Nowitzki started playing basketball at around 13 years old. In the 1998 NBA draft, he was picked ninth overall by the Milwaukee Bucks, 
            then traded to Dallas (Augustyn, n.d., para 2). His first few seasons in the NBA had him struggling, as he did not have the developed skills to play with the professionals. Around the 2000's was when Nowitzki 
            started to shine. In the 2000-01 season, Nowitzki was one of the top 20 scorers, averaging 23.4 points and 9.9 rebounds per game. As the seasons went on, Nowitzki continuted to hone his skills.
            In this era, Nowitzki was an all star for many consecutive seasons. With his leadership and his limited surrounding cast, Nowitzki lead the Dallas Mavericks to the NBA finals in the 2005-06, and ultimately lost to
            the Miami Heat in six games. They eventually redeemed themselves against the Heat in the 2010-11 NBA championship in six games.

        <h2>The Chip</h2>
        <p>The 2010-11 NBA year was absolutely stacked in terms of powerhouses. With teams like the Oklahoma City Thunder, Chicago Bulls with MVP Derrick Rose, the previous champions, The Los Angeles Lakers with Kobe Bryant,
            and a very stacked Miami Heat with Lebron James, Dwyane Wade, and Chris Bosh, it wasn't an easy path for the Mavs. Being ranked third in the western conference, Nowitzki and the Mavs had to fight through the Trail Blazers,
            the Lakers, and the Thunder. When they reached the finals, the Mavs had to verse the heat. They had the chance to vindicate themselves from the horrible finals run in 2006. With game one lost, fans assumed the 
            Heat would steamroll the Mavs in four. This was not the case. Each game was marginally close, but thanks to the choking of Lebron James, Nowitzki and the Mavs managed to win in six. With his surrounding cast, Nowitzki 
            gave Dallas their first NBA championship in league history.

    <h2>The Spectacle</h2>
        <p>Contrasting Dirk's differing seasons show the amount of growth he's had within his NBA tenure. In his rookie season, Nowitzki only averaged 8.2 points per game at a 40.5 field goal percentage, 0.3 three points made, 
            3.4 rebounds per game, and only 1 assist per game. In the 2005-06 season, arguably his best season in his career, Nowitzki averaged 26.6 points per game, 48 percent from the three point line, 9 rebounds and 2.8 assists per game. 
            A massive improvement over his rookie year. That year, the Mavs clinched the fifth seed in the Western Conference of the NBA, and met the Miami Heat in the 2006 finals. The 2010-11 Mavs had one of their best runs in their league history,
            beating the Heat in the finals. That year, Nowitzki managed to average 23 points, 7 rebounds, 2.6 assists and 0.6 blocks a game to cement himself as one of the greatest in NBA history. His stats portray how dominant he was on the court.
            Dirk's guidance and authority paved the way for their first championship, and will be forever known as one of the greatest seven footers to play the game.
